=head1 NAME

Aspect::Library::Trace - Aspect-oriented function call tracing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Aspect;
  use Aspect::Library::Trace;
  
  aspect Trace => call qr/^Foo::/;
  
  Foo::foo1
    Foo::foo2
      Foo::foo3
  Foo::foo2
    Foo::foo3
  Foo::foo2
    Foo::foo3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<L<Aspect> Oriented Programming> is a programming paradigm that increases
modularity by enabling improved separation of concerns.

It is most useful when dealing with cross-cutting concerns that would
otherwise require code to be scattered around in many places.

B<Aspect::Library::Trace> is an L<Aspect> library that implements nested
functional call tracing, in the style formerly offered by the C<dprofpp -T>
command provided by L<Devel::DProf> (before that module became unusable).

=head2 Conventional Usage

The basic usage is very simple, just create an C<Trace> aspect as shown
in the L</SYNOPSIS>.

Load Aspect, then Aspect::Library::Trace, then create the aspect using
the C<aspect> function.

Any calls to functions described in the pointcut will be printed to
C<STDERR>. Nesting is indicated via indenting.

Because the depth is tracked at a per-Aspect level, you should avoid
creating more than one trace Aspect or the indenting levels will be
mixed up and the output will become largely meaningless.

=head2 Import Usage

For even more convenience (and even less typing) you can use the
following shorthand 1-line form.

  use Aspect::Library::Trace qr/^Module::/;

When used this way, you also don't need to C<use Aspect>.
